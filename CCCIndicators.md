###Here are some additional indicators that I picked up from chatting with Kate Stewart and David Wheeler from the Linux Foundation and CII project: 

- Dependency Depth 
- Bug Response Rate 
- Diversity of Contributors (by affiliation)

- Maintainers from different companies
- New participants having a decision making position 

- Contributions are going up beyond the core team 
- Portions of the code base are decreasing from one company (Intel)

- Test Coverage 
- Vulnerability Tools
