**Red Hat community manager meeting at the Red Hat Annex**

### Discussion
1. Project context factors
  - contribution size
  - dependencies
  - diversity
    - geographic
    - corporate
  - Foundation Support?
  - Governance model
2. Making sense of the signals
  - Open Source
  - Crowd sourcing
  - Citizen science
3. What is the connection between metrics and goals? As a community manager I have particular goals for my community, for example.  How do I know which metrics are connected to those goals? How does this evolve?
4. Awareness of datasets is an issue.  CM's do not always have a sense of what data is available for them.
5. Algorithms for community managers: An idea
6. What are the stories about communities who reached goals that my community wants to reach? How do I find those stories?
7. FAM: Frequently Asked Metrics.  What are they?
8. Metrics
  - How do I identify toxic assholes?
  - How do we grow new communities around existing software projects that get open sourced? The Red Hat model includes the acquisition of software companies and the open sourcing of their projects. When the product gets released before the project gets off the ground its then super hard to get a project going
  - Contributor companies
  - Documentation access (from clickstream for project website)
9. Data Sources
  - Stack Overflow
  - Internal systems
  - Job Listings
  - Project website clickstream data
  - Release retrospectives (some Red Hat projects gather retrospective information from contribtors and stakeholders following a release)
  - Mailing Lists
  - Local cultural customs. (i.e., the Christmas holidays are a big slowdown in the US, but not at all in India)
10. Collaboration Ideas
  - A Data Science team to work with Red Hat Community managers.  Provides them with data AND analysis, facilitating the iterative development of metrics.
11. Language
  - Upstream and downstream are not well understood across open source.
  - For Red Hat, the key distinction is between "project" and "product"
  - "Wild West" is not a favored idiom for some folks
  - "Tragedy of the Commons" is a core concept for OSS folks to understand
  - Key Red Hat Value system: A development environment is not as stable as an enterprise enviromment.
12. Diversity Discussion
  - Free software foundation and privacy concerns go together, so diversity is going to touch questions about privacy
  - Measures
    - Corporate
    - Geo/Nationality
    - race
    - gender
    - age
    - SES: What are the implications
