# Sloan Papers

## Sloan Paper Goals as Stated
At least two peer-reviewed publications or conference presentations
1. A multidisciplinary survey of theoretical models of work within organizations and the ways that open source software development complicates them
2. Public dissemination of open source software used to determine open source community health and sustainability
3. Archiving and documentation of repository health and sustainability extracted from Github trace data

## Detailed Planning
1. Review of health and sustainability (Theory Heavy)
  - Metrics in the past
  - How people do this (CII Census project (core infrastructure white paper))
  - Signaling theory ??
  - Venue: Possibly MISQ or ISR, especially if we frame it through the lens of signaling theory.
  - Paper can be [viewed and edited on OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AgtaWBZ3pGD-hLQgbq7ey7LPgvw8wg)
  - [Guzdial chart outlining paper](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AgtaWBZ3pGD-hK9H8KJ_jaC3N9temg)
2. Initial empirical exploration of health and sustainability (Empirical Heavy)
  - Hermeneutic circle for the sense making
    - Continue to do interviews and outreach
      - Asking individuals what they think of as health and sustainability
      - What measures and indicators are relevant
    - Simultaneously, we are developing systems around these indicators
      - We build these out, then run them past informants and use that insight to iterate the indicators, as well as our understanding of what "health and sustainability means"
      - for the 3 use cases
  - Three use cases
    - Releasing internal IP as an OSS Project
    - Using open source and bringing it in as part of your own internal innovation stream
    - You're a foundation, and you're looking to onboard an open source community or help manage the communities you are currently brokering.
    - Possibly Fourth Use Case: Understanding the uptake, use, and participation of individual in open source software projects.
  - Venue: ACM

  - [Guzdial chart outlining paper](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AgtaWBZ3pGD-hK8-DFzQ9qm-aQAQnQ)
3.  Multidisciplinary Survey: Short descriptions of the theoretical models. Possibly a classification of the research models. Possibly a framework that relates the theoretical models. Possibly a list of open research questions. (Overall Heaviest Paper: Theory and Empirical Work)
  - The work of people and companies in communities
  - Changing nature of work ?? Kind ..
  - Venue: ISR or MISQ
  - Possibly about these communities and the integration of things within communities .. figuring out how work has changed until today ... not about now or looking into the future ...
  - **Changing nature of work** : These are longer pole questions, IMHO ... Kate offered for us to connect with Fossology, and .. perhaps the third paper is about the changing nature of work from a case perspective ... perhaps as a case study of Fossology ..
  - **Zephyr** community may be another candidate, in addition to Fossology ..

# <a name="control-papers"></a>Control Papers
- Our goal is to create synergies between the Sloan project and the control paper
- Central to our thinking are **brokers**, which we understand in two ways
  - platform as a broker that enables recursive publics, example: Linux Foundation, Reddit
    - Could we call this the *'ecosystem'* perspective?
  - people (group of people) as a broker between otherwise disconnected groups, example: people in the Linux Foundation that talk to more than one community
    - A social network perspective

## Contributions
1. Control in open environments
  - Control literature is not yet adapted to environments where controls have to account for people who have the freedom to leave at any time and choose what they want to do in recursive public.
2. Dynamic and balance of control in open environments
  - Contro literature is mostly a snapshot of the control mechanisms in place and we would contribute an account for how controls are changing over time, uncovering the dynamics at play and the balance that community members strive for.
3. Control in the inception and evolution of an open source community
  - Control literature is exclusively on existing systems and we would for the first time introduce control from the inception of a community and how the controls evolve.
4. Control between communities in an open environment
  - Control literature does not yet understand how control between communities works.

## Control Paper 1
- Focus on contributions 1-3
- In-depth case study of the LF OSS Health Group
- Source of data: Interviews, history in Wiki and Mailing list, and artifacts produced by the group
- Research question: What are the controls and operations?
  - Sub-research question 1 (Dynamics): How do the controls change and are balanced?
- Thought: Maybe we can empirically show early in the paper that controls in open environments exist and are an interesting phenomenon. Then we transition to the in-depth case study to uncover the complexity of the controls.

## Control Paper 2
- After 1st year of OSS Health Group, because this information is not yet available
- Focus on contribution 1, 2, and 4
- Cross-case analysis of more than one community that are related/interacting
- Source of data: Interviews (why?), and mining software repositories (how?)
  - Sometimes people disappear from a project but that is probably not documented but can be the result of deliberate intentions of some community member(s)
  - We would conceptualize metrics regarding control
- Research question: What are the controls and operations?
  - Sub-research question (between): What are the control tensions and control contradictions
