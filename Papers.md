# Sloan Papers

## Sloan Paper Goals as Stated
1. A multidisciplinary survey of theoretical models of work within organizations and the ways that open source software development complicates them
2. Public dissemination of open source software used to determine open source community health and sustainability
3. Archiving and documentation of repository health and sustainability extracted from Github trace data

## Detailed Planning
1. Review of health and sustainability (Theory Heavy)
  - Metrics in the past
  - How people do this (CII Census project (core infrastructure white paper))
  - Signaling theory ??
  - Venue: Possibly MISQ or ISR, especially if we frame it through the lens of signaling theory.
  - Paper can be [viewed and edited on OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AgtaWBZ3pGD-hK84ev696kevZS1dbA)
  - [Guzdial chart outlining paper](https://1drv.ms/w/s!AgtaWBZ3pGD-hK9H8KJ_jaC3N9temg)
2. Initial empirical exploration of health and sustainability (Empirical Heavy)
  - Hermeneutic circle for the sense making
    - Continue to do interviews and outreach
      - Asking individuals what they think of as health and sustainability
      - What measures and indicators are relevant
    - Simultaneously, we are developing systems around these indicators
      - We build these out, then run them past informants and use that insight to iterate the indicators, as well as our understanding of what "health and sustainability means"
      - for the 3 use cases
  - Three use cases
    - Releasing internal IP as an OSS Project
    - Using open source and bringing it in as part of your own internal innovation stream
    - You're a foundation, and you're looking to onboard an open source community or help manage the communities you are currently brokering.
      - Bradly coon : Software freedom conservancy
    - Possibly Fourth Use Case: Understanding the uptake, use and participation of individual in open source software projects.
  - Venue: ACM

3.  Multidisciplinary Survey: Short descriptions of the theoretical models. Possibly a classification of the research models. Possibly a framework that relates the theoretical models. Possibly a list of open research questions. (Overall Heaviest Paper: Theory and Empirical Work)
  - The work of people and companies in communities
  - Changing nature of work ?? Kind ..
  - Venue: ISR or MISQ
  - Possibly about these communities and the integration of things within communities .. figuring out how work has changed until today ... not about now or looking into the future ...
  - ** Changing nature of work ** : These are longer pole questions, IMHO ... Kate offered for us to connect with Fossology, and .. perhaps the third paper is about the changing nature of work from a case perspective ... perhaps as a case study of Fossology ..
  - ** Zephyr ** community may be another candidate, in addition to Fossology ..
