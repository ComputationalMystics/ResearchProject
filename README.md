# Health Indicators
For more information on health indicators, check out the [Linux Foundation Working Group: OSS Health Metrics](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/oss-health-metrics/start).

# How do we work?
We follow a dual approach for collecting and testing health indicators.

1) We interviews industry experts about the indicators they use or would like to use.
2) We survey the literature for health indicators.
3) We implement health indicators and bring them back to industry experts.
4) We engage in the [Linux Foundation Working Group: OSS Health Metrics](https://wiki.linuxfoundation.org/oss-health-metrics/start).
