# Health Indicators
Many people are interested in the health and sustainability of open source communities.
This repository is collecting health inidicators.

# Where do the health indicators come from?
We follow a dual approach for collecting health indicators.

1) We interviews industry experts about the indicators they use or would like to use.
2) We survey the literature for health indicators.
3) Contributors like you working with us here on GitHub :-)
