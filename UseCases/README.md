# Use Cases

We have four major use cases:

1. Organizations seek metrics for open source communities before becoming engaged or using the software <sup>[<a href="1-org-outside.md">1-org-outside</a>]</sup>
2. Organizations seek metrics for open source communities that they actively engage or use the software <sup>[<a href="2-org-engaged.md">2-org-engaged</a>]</sup>
3. Open source foundations seek metrics for helping open source communities <sup>[<a href="3-foundation.md">3-foundation</a>]</sup>
4. Open source community leaders seek metrics for managing their communities <sup>[<a href="4-oss.md">4-oss</a>]</sup>

At the core are these use cases:
1. The [View Metrics](view-metrics.md) use case allows users to retrieve metrics
   for one repository and builds the basis for all of the above use cases.
2. The [Compare Repositories](compare-repositories.md) use case allows users to
   provide multiple repositories for comparison.
