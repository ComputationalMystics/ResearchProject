# Development
- Both teams agreed containerization (probably Docker) is probably needed as our scope has grown to require the repos themselves in addition to GHTorrent/GitHub API
- Risk metrics are important for this projects' continued support
- Dev focus right now is on designing architecture around containerization, or finding alternative solutions
- JSON schema needs to be formalized, Matt's working on getting that started

# Linux Foundatiom
- Wiki now contains all the metrics we were working on, GitHub documents should not be used now (I say in a GitHub document...)
- All communication regarding metrics should take place on the Linux Foundation mailing list
