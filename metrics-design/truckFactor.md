I've found some papers on the subject of calculating truck/bus factor.
If we want to include truck factor as a metric, they might be a place to start.
So far, though, I have not found a standard way to calculate truck factor.

Links to papers:

A short paper that includes a description on how the authors calculated truck factor based on previous research

Two longer and more detailed papers developing the calculations used above:

An alternative way of calculating bus, which mentions a tool created by the authors to calculate bus factor:

Another alternative, though the authors emphasize it is preliminary:
